      Sugartracker is a website based application, which stores a database of
      sugar based drinks and exercises to burn the calories from the drinks off. This web application can
      be accessed by both "visitors", who can browse information in the site, and "users", who can create an account to track their personal consumption.
      The creation of this web application required front-end and back-end development and design.

    <h4>The Problem</h4>
    <p>
      Sugary drinks have been a major cause for diabetes and other disease.
      They are cheap, easily available and a lot of sugar can be consumed in just a
      few gulps. They have become more accesible than water itself in some areas, but there is
      a lack of awareness of the quantity of sugar in these drinks, and a way to track personal consumption.
    </p>
    <h4>Concept</h4>
    <p>Initial Considerations</p>
    <p>To remedy this problem, we brainstormed a solution. We thought if people could be more aware of these problems through personal tracking,
      awareness would increase, consumption would decrease, thus reducing potential health risks associated with sugar consumption.</p>

      INSERT SITE MAP
      INSERT ER DIAGRAM
      TALK ABOUT USER SCENARIOS, DATA, FEATURES, POSSIBLE DECISIONS,

      <p>CHANGES (and why, before and after)</p>
      <ul>
        <li>see the equivalent measures of sugar that they consume (ex. in sugar
          cubes, gummy bears, etc)</li>
          <li>make their own custom drinks for adding to database</li>
          <li>this list will clear in a week and give them a warning if they are close or
            over their customized maximum sugar intake.</li>
            <li>track the drinks they drink in a week</li>
            <li>See the equivalent measures of sugar content in any drinks in terms of other common sweets, such as gummy bears.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>
            Future Considerations
            "now I learned..." moment
          </h4>
          <p>If we had time to continue this project, we could add a feature to measure the other fats or unhealthy factors of each drink to give the user an idea of what they put in their bodies.</p>
