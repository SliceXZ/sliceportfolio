    <p>Category: 7-hour design jam</p>

      <p>In the <em>Ideas Into Ventures</em> Design Jam hosted by Coast Capital Savings
        Venture Connection, participants were randomly dispersed into teams, making
        sure each team had a mix of students with design, engineering, and business
        backgrounds. My team worked with the prompt:</p>

        <p><em>&#34;Much of the cutting
          edge of AI research and development now takes place within the walls of
          companies whose primary business model is advertising &#8212; and so, having this
          existing profit motive to serve, it&#39;s only natural that their first priority would be to apply their innovations toward
          growing their business. What solutions can we propose to free our attention
          from the clutches of powerful tools like AlphaGo (a project by Google&#39;s
          DeepMind division) so that we can &#34;want what we want to want&#34;?&#34; </em></p>
        </div>

        <div class = "section">
          <h3>Problem Analysis</h3>

          <p>After some discussion, we realized that because
            auto-generated content usually shows up on a user&#39;s feed based on the user&#39;s
            previously consumed content, the user does not need to think much about what
            they want, and that can lead to users not knowing what they want. It may also
            lead users to continuously view content of similar topics. In extreme examples
            involving sensitive political/social topics, this can lead to the user being
            stuck in an echo chamber.</p>


            <h3>Ideation</h3>

            <p>Prompted by the content on the Facebook page InfoWars and the arising incel
              movement, we set out to narrow our target to echo chambers regarding
              controversial topics. One strong focus we had was the negative effects on society that came
              with the incel movement.</p>


              <p>Opportunity statements generated include:</p>

              <p>How may we put an end to &#39;echo chamber&#39; thinking?</p>

              <p>How may we gradually transition unaware users out of their
                echo chambers?</p>


              <p>We created a persona to create a focus on the target
                market:</p>

                  <p>"Bob is a 25-year-old
                    college student working a part-time low-paying job. He spends most of his free
                    time playing video games and browsing the internet. Because Bob feels
                    demotivated and victimized in life, and he commonly views Facebook posts and
                    pages about sensitive topics (including InfoWars),
                    Bob is continuously developing chauvinistic and anti-immigration beliefs. Bob
                    may feel self-righteous, but the grasp that AI-generated content has on his
                    viewing habits only pushes him further into his echo chamber."</p>

                    <h3>Discussion and Challenges</h3>

                    <p>Throughout our ideation process, we discovered two
                      ways to categorize our solution&#39;s approach: Prevention vs Correction.
                      Prevention would involve education early on in grade school about the power of
                      AI to influence our desires and habits. Correction would involve gradually
                      rehabilitating someone who appears unaware they are in a harmful echo chamber.</p>

                      <p>We thought of the different ways users could react to
                        prevention and correction. While prevention could work if children had repeated
                        education on the dangers of excessively consuming auto-generated content, they
                        may see it as an uninterested 	&#39;extra class	&#39; the teachers push on them. A challenge with
                        correction include that it will not work effectively if there are explicit reminders that a
                        user is stuck in an echo chamber. That could be viewed as an infringement on
                        their rights to freedom of belief and potentially repel the user. </p>

                        <p>We chose the corrective approach, as it opened doors
                          to include consistent positive reminders to a user&#39;s social media feed, which
                          they likely use very frequently. Freeing users of their echo chambers can only
                          be a long-term potential solution with this approach. The reason this approach
                          works with our persona is because Bart cannot easily find something to be
                          positive about in real life, so he turns to the internet to vent his feelings. This
                          can imply he feels lonely, and that he desires doses of positivity.</p>

                          <h3>Proposed Prototype</h3>

                          <p>The proposed prototype, named Rebound, is our solution
                            to help users at risk of over-consuming AI generated sensitive content that can
                            ingrain echo chamber modes of thought. The prototype is a middleman advertising
                            service used in automated content generation. </p>

                            <p>Rebound communicates with business who use AI for
                              advertising, such as Facebook and Google, and provides non-profit organizations
                              and for-profit businesses with the opportunity to target audiences like Bart. Rebound
                              will detect if a user is potentially at risk of over-consumption of
                              auto-generated content of a sensitive, echo-chamber-prone topic by recording the frequency they see such content
                              and the duration of time they spend on it.</p>

                              <p>The value Rebound adds to the user&#39;s social media
                                experience include the ability for not-for-profit organizations and for-profit
                                businesses to understand and target at-risk audiences, provide users with
                                advertisement services that cannot be selected through automated generation,
                                and to offset the negative feelings that may fuel echo-chamber thinking.
                                Through targeted advertising, Rebound also increases awareness of mental health
                                issues prevalent in society today.</p>

                                  <h3>Creating the Prototype</h3>
                                  <p>After the design jam was over, I created the prototype on my own using Proto.io, since the design jam
                                    did not have a technology requirement and few people had time to create digital presentation materials.
                                    On our presentation slides, my teammate Raaj made a starter interface for companies to choose their advertising interests. </p>

                                    <img class = "responsive-img" src = "assets/rebound/starter_mockup.jpg"/>

                                    <p>I moved forward with the idea of a scrollable front page containing all the information since
                                      this concept of Rebound&#39;s AI can be unclear to a first-time user. These scrolling pages contained information
                                      about what Rebound is, who are the providers, who are the end users, and what the end result looks like to the users.
                                      In customer service, Rebound&#39;s focused was established as promoting positive thinking and a positive browsing experience, since
                                      this can be a step toward converting negative ideologies on the internet.</p>

                                      <div class = "row">
                                        <div class = "col s6"><img class = "responsive-img" src = "assets/rebound/conceptmockupbefore.png"/></div>
                                        <div class = "col s6"><img class = "responsive-img" src = "assets/rebound/conceptmockupafter.png"/></div>
                                      </div>

                                      <p>I also needed a conceptual visualization for the difference between 	&#39;before&#39; and &#39;after&#39; to clearly convey the idea.
                                        This was implemented on the final scrolling page before the button to go to the login page. A business wanting to get involved
                                        with positive AI-generated content could sign up/log in with an email and password, and select their advertising interests similar
                                        to how it was displayed on the starter interface. </p>

                                        <p>As I had not worked with Proto.io&#39;s scrollable containers beforehand, a part of the challenge was to figure out how to add
                                          interactions to the containers while keeping in mind what scope the other UI elements were (inside or outside of a certain container).
                                          The colour scheme had green and cool gray hues, as green signified positivity and I felt it distracting to have another non-neutral
                                          colour in the palette.</p>

                                          <h3>Further Considerations</h3>

                                          <p>During Q&amp;A, a question was how we could handle
                                            negative feelings that come from competitive gaming, which the user is not
                                            passively viewing, but actively participating in. We consider this to be future
                                            avenue of expansion, since some gaming communities are known to be toxic and
                                            their members are expected to conform. A start could be to reach out to
                                            positive gaming communities and allow them to generate positive messages or
                                            gaming meetups through Rebound&#39;s service. </p>
