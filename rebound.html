        <h1>Rebound</h1>

        <p>Category: 7-hour design jam</p>

        <p>Tools: Design thinking, diagramming, Adobe
          Illustrator, Proto.io</p>

          <p>Team: Team of 6, mix of engineering, economics, and
            business students</p>

            <div class = "section"></div>

            <p>In the Ideas Into Ventures Design Jam hosted by Coast Capital Savings
              Venture Connection, participants were randomly dispersed into teams, making
              sure each team had a mix of students with design, engineering, and business
              backgrounds. My team worked with the prompt:</p>

              <p>“Much of the cutting
                edge of AI research and development now takes place within the walls of
                companies whose primary business model is advertising – and so, having this
                existing profit motive to serve, it’s only natural that their first priority would be to apply their innovations toward
                growing their business. What solutions can we propose to free our attention
                from the clutches of powerful tools like AlphaGo (a project by Google’s
                DeepMind division) so that we can “want what we want to want”?” </p>

                <h3>Problem Analysis</h3>

                <p>After some discussion, we realized that because
                  auto-generated content usually shows up on a user’s feed based on the user’s
                  previously consumed content, the user does not need to think much about what
                  they want, and that can lead to users not knowing what they want. It may also
                  lead users to continuously view content of similar topics. In extreme examples
                  involving sensitive political/social topics, this can lead to the user being
                  stuck in an echo chamber.</p>


                  <h3>Ideation</h3>

                  <p>Prompted by the content on the Facebook page InfoWars and the arising incel
                    movement, we set out to narrow our target to echo chambers regarding
                    controversial topics. </p>


                    <p>Opportunity statements generated include:</p>

                    <p>How may we put an end to ‘echo chamber’ thinking?</p>

                    <p>How may we gradually transition unaware users out of their
                      echo chambers?</p>

                      <div class = "section"></div>

                      <p>We created a persona to create a focus on the target
                        market:</p>

                        <p>“Bob is a 25-year-old
                          college student working a part-time low-paying job. He spends most of his free
                          time playing video games and browsing the internet. Because Bob feels
                          demotivated and victimized in life, and he commonly views Facebook posts and
                          pages about sensitive topics (including InfoWars),
                          Bob is continuously developing chauvinistic and anti-immigration beliefs. Bob
                          may feel self-righteous, but the grasp that AI-generated content has on his
                          viewing habits only pushes him further into his echo chamber.”</p>

                          <div class = "section"></div>

                          <h3>Discussion and Revision</h3>

                          <p>Throughout our ideation process, we discovered two
                            ways to categorize our solution’s approach: Prevention vs Correction.
                            Prevention would involve education early on in grade school about the power of
                            AI to influence our desires and habits. Correction would involve gradually
                            rehabilitating someone who appears unaware they are in a harmful echo chamber.</p>

                            <p>We thought of the different ways users could react to
                              prevention and correction. While prevention could work if children had repeated
                              education on the dangers of excessively consuming auto-generated content, they
                              may see it as an uninterested “extra class” the teachers push on them. As for
                              correction, it will not work effectively if there are explicit reminders that a
                              user is stuck in an echo chamber. That could be viewed as an infringement on
                              their rights to freedom of belief. </p>

                              <p>We chose the corrective approach, as it opened doors
                                to include consistent positive reminders to a user’s social media feed, which
                                they likely use very frequently. Freeing users of their echo chambers can only
                                be a long-term potential solution with this approach. The reason this approach
                                works with our persona is because Bart cannot easily find something to be
                                positive about in real life, he turns to the internet to vent his feelings. This
                                can imply he feels lonely, and that he desires doses of positivity.</p>

                                <h3>Proposed Prototype</h3>

                                <p>The proposed prototype, named Rebound, is our solution
                                  to help users at risk of over-consuming AI generated sensitive content that can
                                  ingrain echo chamber modes of thought. The prototype is a middleman advertising
                                  service used in automated content generation. </p>

                                  <p>Rebound communicates with business who use AI for
                                    advertising, such as Facebook and Google, and provides non-profit organizations
                                    and for-profit businesses with the opportunity to target audiences like Bart. Rebound
                                    will detect if a user is potentially at risk of over-consumption of
                                    auto-generated content of a sensitive, echo-chamber-prone topic. </p>

                                    <div class = "section"></div>


                                    <p>The value Rebound adds to the user’s social media
                                      experience include the ability for not-for-profit organizations and for-profit
                                      businesses to understand and target at-risk audiences, provide users with
                                      advertisement services that cannot be selected through automated generation,
                                      and to offset the negative feelings that may fuel echo-chamber thinking.
                                      Through targeted advertising, Rebound also increases awareness of mental health
                                      issues prevalent in society today.</p>

                                      <div class = "section"></div>

                                      <p>Further Considerations:</p>

                                      <p>During Q&amp;A, a question was how we could handle
                                        negative feelings that come from competitive gaming, which the user is not
                                        passively viewing, but actively participating in. We consider this to be future
                                        avenue of expansion, since some gaming communities are known to be toxic and
                                        their members are expected to conform. A start could be to reach out to
                                        positive gaming communities and allow them to generate positive messages or
                                        gaming meetups through Rebound’s service. </p>
