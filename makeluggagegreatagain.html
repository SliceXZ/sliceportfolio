  <h5>Motivation</h5>
  <p>
    We were to choose from two paths in the final project; create a technological solution to a challenge people face today, or create a new method of interaction in the domain human-computer interaction. We chose the first path. After brainstorming ideas on common problems, we all agreed
    that packing for a trip abroad and remembering allowed weights and luggage policies posed a hassle.
  </p>
  <h5>Features</h5>

  <p>
    Make Luggage Great Again is an application developed to remedy
    a problem faced today by travelers for business or leisure, solo or in a group. This travel weight tracker application aims to solve the overweight luggage issue by letting users measure luggage weight as they pack their bags without later realizing they are overweight and having to choose what to unpack.
  </p>

  </div>
  <p>
    Users can input items into Make Luggage Great Again so they know of the approximate current weight at any time. If they surpassed the maximum weight that their airline allows for check or cabin baggage, the application will notify them. They can then go straight back to their items list to choose what to remove instead of looking at a possibly tightly-packed bag and choosing.
  </p>

  </div>
  <p>Users can also to enter custom items and custom weights into the database if they are packing uncommon items such as instruments or sports gear.</p>
  <p>The application is developed in Android Studio using Java, and the databasing was handled by an external library,<a href="http://satyan.github.io/sugar/getting-started.html"> Sugar ORM</a>. I found Sugar’s methods and variable naming rules confusing at first, but it was significantly less complex compared to the MySQL approach.</p>
  <h5>User Testing</h5>
  <p>We gave 3 different users, all of whom are in different age groups and different experience levels with mobile applications, a series of tasks to perform with Make Luggage Great Again. The purpose was to analyze potential openings for human error and areas of improvement. Tasks assigned were:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>You are packing your luggage for an upcoming trip. You need to add a new bag
      with the name ([Your Name]’s Carry On Bag) and set a weight limit of 22 units.</li>
      <li>Add 3 items (Laptop, empty water bottle, paper and pen) to your bag. Then,
        make a custom item called “Desktop” with the weight of 3.5 units.</li>
        <li>Since your luggage is overweight, you will need to remove an item from your
          list so remove item (Desktop).</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          The participants’ times in seconds were recorded. A common problem identified was that there was no confirmation for adding or subtracting items from the packing list, which changed the overall weight. We believed that at least a toast message was necessary to communicate the successful insertion or removal of items.

        </div>
        <h5>Future Considerations</h5>
        <p>Aside from user feedback, I believe it is worth it to include a screen with a general guideline on airlines and their policies on excess baggage, quantity of baggage, and forbidden items. Most airlines have the same maximum weights and policies, and the main difference is whether or not is it a domestic, international, or inter-continental flights. We could also consider the return flight and provide information on what users should be aware of on declaration forms.</p>
